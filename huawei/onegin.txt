Not with a notion of delighting 
Proud worldlings, but to pleasure you, 

For friendship’s sake would I were writing 
A nobler page, more fine and true, 

Worthy of him I am addressing, 

Whose days are living poetry — 

Affection’s pledge, indeed, expressing 
Your dreams, your high simplicity. 

No matter— ah, but look with favor 
Upon the chapters in your hand,
